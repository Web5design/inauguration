There was a man, a black man, sitting on our porch.  We lived in the south and this was the early 60&#8217;s. My mother came out the door and said to me &#8220;He was hungry so I fed him.  Don&#8217;t tell you father.&#8221;  This Christmas our daughter came to us with a concern for one of her classmates, his name is Jamail.  Jamail, along with his mother and sister,  were living in a very cheap motel and where being kicked out with no place to go.   My heart broke.  I had studied poverty in college but studing it is not the same as experiencing it and with Jamail and his family I was getting a close of picture it.  We dropped food off at the motel for them nearly every night during the holidays.  It seems as if I cried every time on the drive back home.    We simply have too many living in poverty in this wealthy country of ours, it is morally wrong.  We need to work together to lift people out with better schools,  living wages, affordable housing, and affordable, decent child care.  We need to also change the perception that poor people are lazy wanting only governmental handouts.    Jamail and his family have become a part of our family and I am working with Jamail&#8217;s mom to find additional resources so that they could move out of the motel.  </p>\n    <p class=\"signature-name\">Signed,<br/>Sharon Jacobs from Houston, TX</p></p>", "state": "published", "short_url": "http://tmblr.co/ZA9QKtbnbvx1", "date": "2013-01-15 00:56:06 GMT", "type": "photo", "slug": "dear-mr-president-i-voted-for-you-one", "blog_name": "inauguration2013"}, {"highlighted": [], "liked": false, "reblog_key": "VojAc0Hf", "format": "html", "timestamp": 1358211111, "note_count": 0, "tags": ["ivotedforyou"], "can_reply": false, "photos": [{"caption": "", "original_size": {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/97c8929950126cf6dcce0668121c02df/tumblr_mgn6efP0lq1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 1600}, "alt_sizes": [{"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/97c8929950126cf6dcce0668121c02df/tumblr_mgn6efP0lq1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 1600}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/97c8929950126cf6dcce0668121c02df/tumblr_mgn6efP0lq1s2fiyro1_500.jpg", "width": 500, "height": 667}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/97c8929950126cf6dcce0668121c02df/tumblr_mgn6efP0lq1s2fiyro1_400.jpg", "width": 400, "height": 533}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/97c8929950126cf6dcce0668121c02df/tumblr_mgn6efP0lq1s2fiyro1_250.jpg", "width": 250, "height": 333}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/97c8929950126cf6dcce0668121c02df/tumblr_mgn6efP0lq1s2fiyro1_100.jpg", "width": 100, "height": 133}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/97c8929950126cf6dcce0668121c02df/tumblr_mgn6efP0lq1s2fiyro1_75sq.jpg", "width": 75, "height": 75}]}], "id": 40560103590, "post_url": "http://inauguration2013.tumblr.com/post/40560103590/dear-mr-president-i-voted-for-you-this", "caption": "<p><p class=\"intro\">Dear Mr. President,</p>\n    <p class=\"voted\" data-vote-type=\"i-voted-for-you\">I voted for you.</p>\n    <p class=\"message\">This is my son.

The bees don&#8217;t have enough nectar to sustain themselves if there is drought. Recent winters have also been warmer than normal and this means that the bees actually need more honey to make it through the winter - honey which they don&#8217;t have because of the previous summer&#8217;s drought.<br/><br/>If we lose the honeybees and the other pollinators, we lose most of our agriculture. Do you want to eat only wind-pollinated corn, wheat and oat mush for breakfast, lunch and dinner?  Neither do I. <br/><br/>We must bring the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels down to 350 ppm or we will lose the pollinators.

In 2008, you offered us hope, a break from the political status quo \u2013 Change. First terms are largely influenced by polls and popularity. After all, you have to win that second, right? President Obama, sir, you have been re-elected because, despite the to-ing and fro-ing of the first term, there are people, like me, who believe in you.<br/><br/>You are an intelligent man. You know what\u2019s important. We MUST fix the economy. YOU MUST set us on that path. We MUST remove Washington from the hands of the lobbyists and special interest groups and return it to the hands of the people. We MUST remove the demagogues from our houses of government and replace them with men and women of integrity and true love and concern for the people \u2013 ALL the people \u2013 of this country. We MUST be the leader of the free world that we claim to be \u2013 and lead fearlessly from the front, earning the respect and trust of our fellow nations through the indivisibility of our policies and our actions.<br/><br/>These are major MUSTS, and they are only a few, but we have the tools to make a start. We have a military that can rebuild the infrastructure of a foreign nation \u2013 how about we turn them loose on rebuilding some cities here at home? We both owe and lend billions upon billions of dollars to other nations \u2013 how about we don\u2019t loan money we don\u2019t have and stop printing money we can\u2019t back up? We have an incredible University education system, which fewer students can afford to attend every year, but our elementary and high school systems are abysmal. We have a functioning House and Senate, though apparently without the occupants with the intestinal fortitude to get much of any real value done. We have a government with great resources and a nation of endless variety and possibility, of which you are the head. Yet we cannot find our path. Where have our priorities gone?<br/><br/>You cannot address these all in four years \u2013 maybe not even in forty \u2013 but you can address some. Select your issues and act. Act fearlessly, Mr. President. Act with integrity and without apology, with sober deliberation, trustworthy and honorable advisors and a humble heart. But Act. When in doubt, look to your people, not to the pundits \u2013 we are much less jaded and cynical. This is the world that our children \u2013 that YOUR children \u2013 will inherit. I encourage you, President Obama, with all the determination of a mother\u2019s soul, to do your utmost as the leader of the most powerful nation on earth, to make changes that you will be proud to pass on to the future.<br/><br/>Fearless. Integrity. Sir.<br/><br/>Your very faithful and true supporter and friend, <br/></p>\n    <p class=\"signature-name\">Signed,<br/>Megan Leigh Gutierrez from Fort Bragg, NC</p></p>", "state": "published", "short_url": "http://tmblr.co/ZA9QKtbnOj8w", "date": "2013-01-15 00:15:36 GMT", "type": "photo", "slug": "dear-mr-president-id-rather-not-say-how-i", "blog_name": "inauguration2013"}]}
