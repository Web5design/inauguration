I never learned more about our country than I did living abroad for 7 years. It really opened my eyes up and made me realize how dependent and expectant this country has become.

I was excited to hear everyone \u201cwanted\u201d to work together on the major economic issues facing the country. However, as a business student I am deeply ashamed by the amount of pork it has taken to just pass a bill. Compromise shouldn\u2019t come in the form of buying someone or their friends. You should be willing to sacrifice some of the main goal. For example, on raising the debt ceiling. It is easy economics to know you must raise taxes (should be on everyone but no one likes that, instead we want everyone else usually the rich to pay for our mistakes) and additionally you must cut spending. An easy solution to this would be we will cut $1 for every dollar you approve in tax increase (or some percentage around there). That would be a negotiation, that is all the American people want to see. Lastly stop blaming the Republicans (I am independent), do you let your daughters blame others? No. So don\u2019t do it, yes they are being stupid at times but you need to go get in the mess of it. I currently think Biden has been more Presidential in how he handled the last two months then you have. <br/><br/>In short please work with others, don\u2019t blame people just keep trying, and lastly don\u2019t promise everyone you will bring us together then put a wall up in negotiations. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time,<br/><br/>A student, who is hoping his leaders will act more like adults than his nephhew. </p>\n    <p class=\"signature-name\">Signed,<br/>William Manning from Fairfield, Vermont</p><p class=\"footnote\">What do <em>you</em> want President Obama to remember in his second term?

This is NOT good or a solution, and we should live within our means. Pull ALL the money out of Military spending, tax the rich at 90% like they used to be, tax churches, eliminate ALL loopholes and deductions in the tax code, and I bet you\u2019ll be real close.

Even thought they do not have oil to fight over they are an entire continent in need of the most basic aid. You can do so much for them just by starting a dialogue. Visiting. Letting Americans see how the real other 99% live. My daughter was eight years old last summer when she and I volunteered in Tanzania. We worked at an art\u2019s school for street children and most of the kids are living without parents and with diseases such as TB, AIDS and sickle cell. It was quite powerful to see my daughter, Calla (adopted from Ethiopia) give her lap to the little ones. Watching a sweet set of four year olds leave the school to wander and look for a place to sleep each afternoon was a better education than any school here in America could have offered her. Please put Africa back on the map for Americans we have much to learn from them and it is so easy to help. Thank you.
