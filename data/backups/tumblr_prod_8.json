I must say that I am saddended by what is happening to our beloved country.  Between people arguing over gun control, immigration, equal rights, the environment and welfare, this country is going to pots.<br/>I am a Democrat who believes in you, but I too feel that people need to get off of welfare and back to work.  I happen to know lots of people on welfare, as I am poor too (I am not on welfare, I work as a lunch lady-money is money! And I am in college online) they want to work, they want a job to go to, Im not sure why people all of a sudden are claiming that welfare recipients are all on drugs and dont want to work (were are those statistics by the way?)  It is rhetoric to separate our great nation.  However, jobs are scarce around here, we need jobs to get people off of welfare!  So job creation is on top of my list. <br/>I dont care if people want to own a gun for safety.  But why own a weapon of mass distruction?  These automatic weapons are unecessary, I hear people talk on Facebook about how they dont want their 2nd Amendment to be compramised, that they want to &#8220;protect&#8221; their families and some go hunting.  Thats fine, but automatic weapons?  Are they planning on taking out the whole herd at once when hunting?  And theives who break into houses or hold people up are only 1 to 2 people at a time, so a semi automatic weapon is again unecessary.  I will not own a gun, the chances/odds of me needing one or being in the right place at the right time to use one is slim to none.  We do have crime in my town of 50,000 plus people, but seriously, its not that bad! I own a dog, theives tend to hit easy targets, not challenging ones.  Besides, I dont have anything worth taking. Too bad the horses are already out of the barn, we cant close the doors now, these weapons are out in the public.  Pure machismo/penile extention and Looky what kind of gun I got!  Please help to control this issue.<br/>The environment is a big issue for me as well, do you know we have several garbage patches in the oceans?  We are abusing our planet and we have no other planet to go to! Also, Stricter punishments for animal abusers, these sick individuals need to actually learn a lesson and be removed from society.  You can learn alot about a person when you see how they treat animals.<br/>I can understand the struggle of people in other countries trying to come here and live, I feel for them, but I agree, they need to do it legally. Even though we are all immigrants, we must go about it legally.  And equal rights for all is still a big issue here in the States, not just for different races, but for the GLBT communities as well.  We need to continue to work on equal rights for all.<br/>I think your doing a great job, it is hard to make changes for the greater good when you have people standing in your way.  Good luck, and please stick to YOUR plans, stand up to the ones that are making decisions that are bad for our country. This separation of poor v rich is going to destroy our country.  Put that foot down, you can do it!<br/>Take care.</p>\n    <p class=\"signature-name\">Signed,<br/>Cris from Chicago</p></p>", "state": "published", "short_url": "http://tmblr.co/ZA9QKtbnEMHv", "date": "2013-01-14 23:43:23 GMT", "type": "photo", "slug": "dear-mr-president-i-voted-for-you-dear", "blog_name": "inauguration2013"}, {"highlighted": [], "liked": false, "reblog_key": "gthOL2x8", "format": "html", "timestamp": 1358206824, "note_count": 0, "tags": ["ididntvoteforyou"], "can_reply": false, "photos": [{"caption": "", "original_size": {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/d4c2c0d3581603eed4ffeb7105ef2ca2/tumblr_mgn33cWtYJ1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "alt_sizes": [{"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/d4c2c0d3581603eed4ffeb7105ef2ca2/tumblr_mgn33cWtYJ1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/d4c2c0d3581603eed4ffeb7105ef2ca2/tumblr_mgn33cWtYJ1s2fiyro1_500.jpg", "width": 500, "height": 375}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/d4c2c0d3581603eed4ffeb7105ef2ca2/tumblr_mgn33cWtYJ1s2fiyro1_400.jpg", "width": 400, "height": 300}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/d4c2c0d3581603eed4ffeb7105ef2ca2/tumblr_mgn33cWtYJ1s2fiyro1_250.jpg", "width": 250, "height": 188}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/d4c2c0d3581603eed4ffeb7105ef2ca2/tumblr_mgn33cWtYJ1s2fiyro1_100.jpg", "width": 100, "height": 75}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/d4c2c0d3581603eed4ffeb7105ef2ca2/tumblr_mgn33cWtYJ1s2fiyro1_75sq.jpg", "width": 75, "height": 75}]}], "id": 40554041393, "post_url": "http://inauguration2013.tumblr.com/post/40554041393/dear-mr-president-i-didnt-vote-for-you", "caption": "<p><p class=\"intro\">Dear Mr. President,</p>\n    <p class=\"voted\" data-vote-type=\"i-didnt-vote-for-you\">I didn&#8217;t vote for you.</p>\n    <p class=\"message\">We Americans have the right to own firearms, to include AR-15&#8217;s.

Few understand the effort and sacrifice it takes to raise a child responsibly&#8230; but I believe you do, Mr. President. I believe you not only acknowledge, but take great comfort in the ability and courage of the American people. As a nation and as individuals, we will face trials of all sorts. But we are strong. </p>\n    <p class=\"signature-name\">Signed,<br/>Jodi MacNeal from Palm Beach Gardens, FL</p></p>", "state": "published", "short_url": "http://tmblr.co/ZA9QKtbn8f-o", "date": "2013-01-14 23:25:29 GMT", "type": "photo", "slug": "dear-mr-president-i-voted-for-you-my", "blog_name": "inauguration2013"}, {"highlighted": [], "liked": false, "reblog_key": "teJ6WyZE", "format": "html", "timestamp": 1358205726, "note_count": 0, "tags": ["ididntvoteforyou"], "can_reply": false, "photos": [{"caption": "", "original_size": {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/061600295802858078b35b622d07d85b/tumblr_mgn28uOfN61s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 612, "height": 612}, "alt_sizes": [{"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/061600295802858078b35b622d07d85b/tumblr_mgn28uOfN61s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 612, "height": 612}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/061600295802858078b35b622d07d85b/tumblr_mgn28uOfN61s2fiyro1_500.jpg", "width": 500, "height": 500}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/061600295802858078b35b622d07d85b/tumblr_mgn28uOfN61s2fiyro1_400.jpg", "width": 400, "height": 400}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/061600295802858078b35b622d07d85b/tumblr_mgn28uOfN61s2fiyro1_250.jpg", "width": 250, "height": 250}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/061600295802858078b35b622d07d85b/tumblr_mgn28uOfN61s2fiyro1_100.jpg", "width": 100, "height": 100}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/061600295802858078b35b622d07d85b/tumblr_mgn28uOfN61s2fiyro1_75sq.jpg", "width": 75, "height": 75}]}], "id": 40552512506, "post_url": "http://inauguration2013.tumblr.com/post/40552512506/dear-mr-president-i-didnt-vote-for-you", "caption": "<p><p class=\"intro\">Dear Mr. President,</p>\n    <p class=\"voted\" data-vote-type=\"i-didnt-vote-for-you\">I didn&#8217;t vote for you.</p>\n    <p class=\"message\">I voted for you the first time, and then I didn&#8217;t vote for you the second.<br/><br/>My taxes just went up, which is ok with me if our national debt goes down.
