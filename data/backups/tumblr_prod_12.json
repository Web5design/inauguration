Stop wasting taxpayer dollars and instead raise money to close the deficit by taxing cannabis. Stop the discrimination against medical-marijuana users who have opted out of using dangerous prescription drugs and supporting prescription drug tycoons. Change drug-testing policies for employment in government and in the private sector so that cannabis users can find gainful employment regardless of their personal, private, and medical decisions. Let them be hired or fired based on the quality of their experience and work instead of allowing them to be dismissed for decisions they make up to ninety days before pre-employment screenings. <br/><br/>Listen to scientists and physicians! &#8220;Throughout my career as a clinical psychiatrist, I have seen lives ruined by drugs like cocaine, painkillers and alcohol. I have also borne witness to the devastation brought upon cannabis users &#8212; almost never by abuse of the drug, but by a justice system that chooses a sledgehammer to kill a weed&#8230;Alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, caffeine and refined sugar are among the most commonly used, potentially habit-forming recreational substances. All are best left out of our daily diets. Only marijuana is illegal, though alcohol and tobacco are clearly more harmful. In several respects, even sugar poses more of a threat to our nation&#8217;s health than pot&#8230;&#8221; - Dr. David Nathan<br/><br/>Stop the incarceration of recreational users and reduce the prison population. It is a waste of money to put people behind bars for non-violent crimes. Support Mexico&#8217;s cry to end the War on Drugs so that cartel violence will decrease along our borders. Rehabilitate drug users because it is more effective than incarceration. Break the cycle.<br/><br/>Change these policies now! American voters and state governments should no longer live under a reality where federal law contradicts laws passed by the people. Marijuana users should feel safe following the laws passed by a majority of users in their state! <br/><br/>Get Wise! Legalize! </p>\n    <p class=\"signature-name\">Signed,<br/>Katie C from Sacramento, CA</p></p>", "state": "published", "short_url": "http://tmblr.co/ZA9QKtbmmkeZ", "date": "2013-01-14 22:10:31 GMT", "type": "photo", "slug": "dear-mr-president-i-voted-for-you-end", "blog_name": "inauguration2013"}, {"highlighted": [], "liked": false, "reblog_key": "Bie2yeYs", "format": "html", "timestamp": 1358201367, "note_count": 0, "tags": ["idrathernotsayhowivoted"], "can_reply": false, "photos": [{"caption": "", "original_size": {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/3230adfc721e0ca206b586e23d56f454/tumblr_mgmyvrhHUL1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 720, "height": 960}, "alt_sizes": [{"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/3230adfc721e0ca206b586e23d56f454/tumblr_mgmyvrhHUL1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 720, "height": 960}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/3230adfc721e0ca206b586e23d56f454/tumblr_mgmyvrhHUL1s2fiyro1_500.jpg", "width": 500, "height": 667}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/3230adfc721e0ca206b586e23d56f454/tumblr_mgmyvrhHUL1s2fiyro1_400.jpg", "width": 400, "height": 533}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/3230adfc721e0ca206b586e23d56f454/tumblr_mgmyvrhHUL1s2fiyro1_250.jpg", "width": 250, "height": 333}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/3230adfc721e0ca206b586e23d56f454/tumblr_mgmyvrhHUL1s2fiyro1_100.jpg", "width": 100, "height": 133}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/3230adfc721e0ca206b586e23d56f454/tumblr_mgmyvrhHUL1s2fiyro1_75sq.jpg", "width": 75, "height": 75}]}], "id": 40546438658, "post_url": "http://inauguration2013.tumblr.com/post/40546438658/dear-mr-president-id-rather-not-say-how-i", "caption": "<p><p class=\"intro\">Dear Mr. President,</p>\n    <p class=\"voted\" data-vote-type=\"id-rather-not-say-how-i-voted\">I&#8217;d rather not say how I voted.</p>\n    <p class=\"message\">Please don&#8217;t forget &#8230; you have a gorgeous wife and two beautiful little girls.

Whereas &#8220;pro life&#8221; just as well divides and generalizes those who support a woman&#8217;s choice, whether or not that choice is enacted upon a sack of cells or a human being is beside the point. Stating that the great white knights of gun control, the saviors of all the dead and wrong in the world, are for &#8220;anti-violence&#8221; completely divides and misrepresents the virtues and ethics for which gun right&#8217;s activists fight. Almost all of the people I know and with whom I connect regarding gun&#8217;s rights, and that&#8217;s hundreds, notwithstanding the dozens of freedom organizations with which I connect, live the most anti-violence, anti-coercive lifestyles in this country. They are anti-war, anti-conflict, peaceful and conscientious objectors. Being a gun&#8217;s rights activist does not make you &#8220;pro-violence.&#8221;<br/><br/>We understand the ethics holistically. We understand that criminals do not follow, and have not followed, laws. We understand that violence occurs due to mental incapacities for rationality within the individual. We understand that guns are used for more purposes than killing, yet we accept that guns can be used, and could be designed, as instruments of death, but that man&#8217;s right to own them for the purposes he sees fit, responsible for all violence against another, is inalienable and unquestionable. As many these &#8220;anti-violence&#8221; advocates for gun control parade the white house and speak of the criminality of all those who support man&#8217;s irrevocable rights for guns in this country, those with whom I keep contact parade the streets for an end to the military industrial complex, the warped moral mentality of those who blindly permit and ignore the violence between governments, but not between individuals. The hundreds of drone strikes, masacres, breaches of &#8220;duty,&#8221; and lack of transparency in government and the military complex&#8212;- these are things that people blindly accept or ignore. You see it as a higher purpose. It&#8217;s &#8220;necessary&#8221; for the propagation of world peace.<br/><br/>Killing thousands, invading the peaceful lifestyles of peoples around the world with the &#8220;intention&#8221; to save millions, is still immoral.   If you are against guns on the basis of its &#8220;anti-violence&#8221; nature, start voicing for the end of GOP vs. Democrat corporatocracy, the overarching coercive power of the state, a transparency in governmental organizations, the violence of the police force, the taxes you pay with blood on its hands, the evils of the FDA-Monsanto idolatry that has been poisoning our food, as well as the world&#8217;s, for years, and ludicrous racial skews in our prisons due to the &#8220;WAR ON DRUGS.&#8221;  You can take the guns away from a warped society, but you cannot take away a warped society from its violence, nor a government over which you yourself preside away from its, your, dissent to drudgery. <br/><br/>If you wish to disarm and &#8220;peace-ify&#8221; the citizens of this country, the powerless, the unheard, the deceived, disarm your protectors, disarm your soldiers, and disarm your drones. You are a murderer. </p>\n    <p class=\"signature-name\">Signed,<br/>George Orwell from Vermont</p></p>", "state": "published", "short_url": "http://tmblr.co/ZA9QKtbmmDdX", "date": "2013-01-14 22:08:57 GMT", "type": "photo", "slug": "dear-mr-president-i-didnt-vote-im", "blog_name": "inauguration2013"}, {"highlighted": [], "liked": false, "reblog_key": "pbnFcvoR", "format": "html", "timestamp": 1358201223, "note_count": 0, "tags": ["ivotedforyou"], "can_reply": false, "photos": [{"caption": "", "original_size": {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/337abaef2d8cdeff57ff2863d4bbba62/tumblr_mgmyrrvS4J1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 960}, "alt_sizes": [{"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/337abaef2d8cdeff57ff2863d4bbba62/tumblr_mgmyrrvS4J1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 960}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/337abaef2d8cdeff57ff2863d4bbba62/tumblr_mgmyrrvS4J1s2fiyro1_500.jpg", "width": 500, "height": 375}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/337abaef2d8cdeff57ff2863d4bbba62/tumblr_mgmyrrvS4J1s2fiyro1_400.jpg", "width": 400, "height": 300}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/337abaef2d8cdeff57ff2863d4bbba62/tumblr_mgmyrrvS4J1s2fiyro1_250.jpg", "width": 250, "height": 188}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/337abaef2d8cdeff57ff2863d4bbba62/tumblr_mgmyrrvS4J1s2fiyro1_100.jpg", "width": 100, "height": 75}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/337abaef2d8cdeff57ff2863d4bbba62/tumblr_mgmyrrvS4J1s2fiyro1_75sq.jpg", "width": 75, "height": 75}]}], "id": 40546237296, "post_url": "http://inauguration2013.tumblr.com/post/40546237296/dear-mr-president-i-voted-for-you-i", "caption": "<p><p class=\"intro\">Dear Mr. President,</p>\n    <p class=\"voted\" data-vote-type=\"i-voted-for-you\">I voted for you.</p>\n    <p class=\"message\">I love the outdoors.

Patients have been turned over to their families for care, and if a family cannot afford to keep a patient in a private health care facility, they are forced to look after them at home.

Last year Michigan judge Sandra Manderfield gave MSU medical student and puppy killer (Andrew David Thompson) probation for killing at least 12 small dogs by throwing them against a wall or breaking legs, etc&#8230;not all at once mind you&#8230;but over a period of time. This is a dangerous person. Just this week my daughter helped rescue 11 puppies from a man that bred them to feed to his snake. He would freeze them alive. The judge in the case actually adopted two of the puppies, so maybe there&#8217;s hope for a strong sentence. Usually it&#8217;s nothing compared to the pain they cause. Also, end BSL - breed discrimination. If I knew a person to be an animal lover and advocate, they get my vote&#8230;it&#8217;s that important to me. </p>\n    <p class=\"signature-name\">Signed,<br/>Val  from Lowell Michigan</p></p>", "state": "published", "short_url": "http://tmblr.co/ZA9QKtbmkYpD", "date": "2013-01-14 22:03:36 GMT", "type": "photo", "slug": "dear-mr-president-i-didnt-vote-for-you", "blog_name": "inauguration2013"}, {"highlighted": [], "liked": false, "reblog_key": "hQCEuMUk", "format": "html", "timestamp": 1358200992, "note_count": 0, "tags": ["ivotedforyou"], "can_reply": false, "photos": [{"caption": "", "original_size": {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/17b515f66c43658909f639833cad27ee/tumblr_mgmylcvKct1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 956}, "alt_sizes": [{"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/17b515f66c43658909f639833cad27ee/tumblr_mgmylcvKct1s2fiyro1_1280.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 956}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/17b515f66c43658909f639833cad27ee/tumblr_mgmylcvKct1s2fiyro1_500.jpg", "width": 500, "height": 373}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/17b515f66c43658909f639833cad27ee/tumblr_mgmylcvKct1s2fiyro1_400.jpg", "width": 400, "height": 299}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/17b515f66c43658909f639833cad27ee/tumblr_mgmylcvKct1s2fiyro1_250.jpg", "width": 250, "height": 187}, {"url": "http://24.media.tumblr.com/17b515f66c43658909f639833cad27ee/tumblr_mgmylcvKct1s2fiyro1_100.jpg", "width": 100, "height": 75}, {"url": "http://25.media.tumblr.com/17b515f66c43658909f639833cad27ee/tumblr_mgmylcvKct1s2fiyro1_75sq.jpg", "width": 75, "height": 75}]}], "id": 40545919256, "post_url": "http://inauguration2013.tumblr.com/post/40545919256/dear-mr-president-i-voted-for-you-im", "caption": "<p><p class=\"intro\">Dear Mr. President,</p>\n    <p class=\"voted\" data-vote-type=\"i-voted-for-you\">I voted for you.</p>\n    <p class=\"message\">I&#8217;m so glad you won, because I believe in you. Climate change from continuing to burn fossil fuels is the biggest threat humanity currently faces. The data show we are at the brink of not being able to change our course, and what goes on in the next 4 years will be critical in deciding which way we end up going. I&#8217;m counting on you to lead the U.S. into doing the right thing - moving away from fossil fuels, supporting alternative energy, and drastically cutting carbon emissions. What other countries are not doing (such as China) is not an excuse for inaction on our part. I want to hear about what we will do here - and we can do a lot more than we&#8217;re doing now. Good luck and please remember - this is the big thing. Fifty years down the road, are our kids and grandkids going to be cursing what we didn&#8217;t do, or talking about how you worked toward turning it around at the 11th hour? Thanks so much.  </p>\n    <p class=\"signature-name\">Signed,<br/>Karen Moody from Westminster, MD</p></p>", "state": "published", "short_url": "http://tmblr.co/ZA9QKtbmkQ4O", "date": "2013-01-14 22:03:12 GMT", "type": "photo", "slug": "dear-mr-president-i-voted-for-you-im", "blog_name": "inauguration2013"}]}
