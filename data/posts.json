Bush, Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot how they were “personally affected by the national debt.” <br /><br />That unusual question was one the candidates clearly hadn’t gotten on the trail. Bush had to answer first, usually a disadvantage since there’s less time to think of an answer and Bush’s response reflected that. Clinton, with more time, gave an answer that showed more empathy. It was a major moment that helped Clinton and hurt Bush. <br /><br />The town-hall style format raises the difficulty factor for Obama. His advisors say he needs to do what he failed to do at the first debate, challenge Romney forcefully when the Republican takes a more centrist position than the positions he held during the Republican primaries when he called himself a severe conservative.
